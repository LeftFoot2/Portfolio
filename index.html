                <li><b>About Me:</b></li>
                <p>Hello! My name is Thomas Jamieson and was born and raised in Fallon, Nevada. I am currently a student attending Brigham Young University Idaho. I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Computer and Electrical Engineering. I love to see all that programming can accomplish! It amazes and excites me to think about where my professional career will take me. I have been married a little over 2 years and my wife and I have a precious little boy. I enjoy playing and watching sports, but especially love playing tennis and pickleball. Playing card, board, and video games with family is another one of my favorite pass times as well.</p>
                <li><b>Projects:</b></li>
                <p>I have made several projects, but I'm most proud of my project 'Remember Words'. Simply put it is a dynamic list that helps the user learn how to spell words that they struggle with. Here is a video that I made that shows the functionally of the application:

            <p>
                Nevada is a desert, most of the land is owned by the government, and it has sagebrush. This is where I called home for the first 18 year of my life. I loved it there. My area of Nevada never got too hot or too cold. I had family all around me and enjoyed many outdoor activities.
