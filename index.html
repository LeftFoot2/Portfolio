                Howdy! My name is Thomas Jamieson! I am married to the amazing MaryAnn Jamieson for time and all eternity! That is the most interesting thing about me, but if you want to know more I'll give a few more tidbits. I enjoy playing games. Video games, board games, card games. It's a good time. I also enjoy playing sports especially tennis and pickleball.

                Nevada ia a desert, most of the land is owned by the government, and it has sagebrush. This is where I called home for the first 18 year of my life. I loved it there. My area of Nevada never got too hot or too cold. I had family all around me and enjoyed many outdoor activities.
