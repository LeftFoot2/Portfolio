                Howdy! My name is Thomas Jamieson! I am married to the amazing MaryAnn Jamieson for time and all eternity! That is the most interesting thing about me, but if you want to know more I'll give a few more tidbits. I enjoy playing games. Video games, board games, card games. It's a good time. I also enjoy playing sports especially tennis and pickleball. I have recently got into making Youtube videos with my brothers and cousin. We have been mostly doing video game content. It has actually been really fun. I have kinda taken it up as a hobby and have enjoyed trying to improve our views. It's been fun. I have also enjoyed developing these websites. I honestly didn't have high expectations for this because I had taken JavaScript before this class and was very lost with the website stuff we needed to do in that class. It has been refreshing to see that it is actually enjoyable to work on websites.

            <p>
                Nevada ia a desert, most of the land is owned by the government, and it has sagebrush. This is where I called home for the first 18 year of my life. I loved it there. My area of Nevada never got too hot or too cold. I had family all around me and enjoyed many outdoor activities.
